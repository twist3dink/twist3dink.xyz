            <p><strong>
	If I told you I was the Devil, would you believe me?
	I walk beside you every day. And every day, it's the same.
	Will today be the day I finally decide to change?
	If not, then you better hope this time it's the right vein.
	I can even turn the lights on if it's too much for you to see.
	Even if they were sorry, it wouldn't change a thing.
	It's strange that we turn to pain as a means to our escape.
	We can either give up or outgrow it, but either way, it hurts the same.
	We lock eyes in the mirror, then stare off into space from our reflection.
	I see your face, but you have never seen mine.
	In fact, the truth is only pretty because you tell me what to see.
	Is it all really as grim as you make it out to be?
	Or are you just dying at a chance for us to finally meet?
	I'm not just some voice in your head—a constant whispering.
	Hate to be the one to tell you, but you're a real part of me.
	There isn’t much I have to say for you to believe
	how I'm the only one you have, and I'm the only one you’ll ever need.
	I could be your past or your present.
	It's all the same to me.
	Better yet, let's make it interesting—let’s say eternity.
	Just imagine a life without me.
	It’s giving f***ing sickening.
	I snapped my fingers and I woke up.
	It was just a lucid dream.
	Shook it off and looked in the mirror.
	He reaches out from it and almost grabs me.
	I pull back and yell NO!
	And then he spoke to me.
	He said that his name was Either.
	He’s what makes my soul burn slow.
	Tried to say he's not the Devil, like I didn’t already know.
	I guess that day was different.
	The scars on my arms have vanished without a trace.
	I can never take it back—the one thing that remains.
	It’s both the end and the beginning of all of my pain, and—
	If there is life after death, I swear that in the next one
	I can never take it back—the one thing that remains.
	It’s both the end and the beginning of all of my pain, and—
	If there is life after death, I swear that in the next one
	I will do whatever it takes for me to change.
	Tears roll down my face and I drop to my knees.
	Started thinking to myself how He could let things happen to me.
	I thought I knew what it was like to really be alone.
	Now that I sit here in the empty dark.
	There is no one else here, not even a single soul.
	Out of nowhere, I feel a hand grab mine.
	"No, my child. This is not yet your time.
	What I have given you is a gift.
	It's him who wants to take your life.
	You've never seen me either, but you would choose him over me?"
	Filled with shame, looking down, there's a crackle in my voice as I say 
	that I'm sorry.
	He lifts my head by the chin and wipes my tears away.
	He smiles and says, "I love you. Don’t forget what you promised me."

            <p>Growing up in foster care, I learned early that survival meant becoming whoever the adults needed me to be. Smile for the case workers. Be quiet for the volatile placements. Disappear when adults needed you gone. I got so good at it that I forgot which mask was supposed to be me.</p>

            <p>But there was always a voice. A quiet whisper that started sometime in childhood and never left. It told me I was <em>broken</em>. That I was <em>too much</em> and simultaneously <em>not enough</em>. That everyone could see through me, and once they did, they'd leave like all the others.</p>

            <p>For years, I thought this voice was the enemy. The devil on my shoulder. The thing keeping me small, keeping me scared, keeping me dissociated and watching my life happen through glass.</p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                "I spent decades trying to silence the voice, never realizing it was the only part of me brave enough to still be speaking."
            </div>

            <p>It took me almost three decades to understand what that voice actually was.</p>

            <p>It wasn't the devil. It was a <strong>sentry</strong>. A guard stationed at the perimeter of my consciousness, doing the only job it knew how to do: keep me safe by keeping me invisible. Because in foster care, visibility meant vulnerability. Being seen meant being hurt.</p>

            <p>That voice wasn't trying to destroy me. It was trying to <em>save</em> me using the only strategy that had ever worked before: make yourself small, make yourself quiet, make yourself whatever they need you to be so they don't hurt you or leave you.</p>

            <div class="section-break">* * *</div>

            <p>The problem was that the war had ended. The foster system that required constant adaptation and hypervigilance was decades in the past. But the sentry didn't know that. It was still stationed at its post, still scanning for threats, still convinced that letting my guard down meant death.</p>

            <p>So when I tried to <strong>be myself</strong> in relationships, the voice screamed: <em>They'll see you're broken and leave.</em></p>

            <p>When I tried to <strong>pursue opportunities</strong>, it whispered: <em>Who do you think you are? You're not qualified for this.</em></p>

            <p>When I tried to <strong>exist without performing</strong>, it panicked: <em>If you're not useful, you're disposable.</em></p>

            <p>I spent years in therapy trying to kill that voice. Cognitive behavioral therapy to "reframe" it. Positive affirmations to drown it out. Medication to numb it. But none of it worked, because I was fighting the wrong battle.</p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                "You can't kill the part of you that kept you alive. You can only thank it for its service and teach it that the war is over."
            </div>

            <p>The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to <em>silence</em> the voice and started <strong>listening</strong> to it differently. Not as an enemy. Not as a saboteur. But as a frightened child stationed at a post, convinced the world was still dangerous, doing the only job it remembered.</p>

            <p>I started talking to it. Not dismissing it. Not arguing with it. Just... acknowledging it.</p>

            <p><em>"I hear you. Thank you for trying to protect me. But I'm safe now. You can rest."</em></p>

            <p>It didn't believe me at first. Years of hypervigilance don't evaporate with a single conversation. But slowly—painfully slowly—the voice started to shift. From <em>"You're broken"</em> to <em>"I'm scared you'll get hurt again."</em> From <em>"You're not enough"</em> to <em>"What if they see us and decide we're not worth keeping?"</em></p>

            <p>The voice was never the devil. It was the <strong>only part of me that never abandoned itself</strong>. The part that refused to stop caring whether I survived, even when survival meant staying small forever.</p>

            <div class="section-break">* * *</div>

            <p>I don't tell you this story because I've "fixed" it. I tell you this because <strong>the voice is still there</strong>. It probably always will be. But now we're on the same team.</p>

            <p>Now when it whispers <em>"They'll leave when they see the real you,"</em> I can respond: <em>"Maybe. But I'd rather be seen and left than invisible and safe. Because invisible isn't living."</em></p>

            <p>The devil on my shoulder wasn't a devil at all. It was a sentry. A guardian. A part of me that cared so much about my survival that it was willing to sacrifice my life to keep me safe.</p>

            <p>And once I understood that, I could finally stop fighting myself and start <em>integrating</em>.</p>

            <p>The war is over. The sentry can rest. But I don't have to kill it to be free.</p>
