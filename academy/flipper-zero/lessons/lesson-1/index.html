        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Important Legal & Ethical Notice</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>⚠️ CRITICAL INFORMATION - READ CAREFULLY</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The Flipper Zero is a powerful tool that must be used responsibly and legally. Understanding these guidelines is essential before proceeding with this course.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Legal Guidelines</h3>
            <p><strong>Only test devices you own or have explicit written permission to test.</strong> Unauthorized access to electronic systems, even for "testing" purposes, is illegal in virtually every jurisdiction worldwide. This includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Access control systems (doors, gates, parking barriers)</li>
                <li>Vehicles that don't belong to you</li>
                <li>RFID/NFC cards or systems you're not authorized to access</li>

                <li>Wireless networks and devices</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>It is illegal to access systems without permission</strong>, regardless of your intentions. "I was just testing security" is not a valid legal defense. In many countries, unauthorized access carries severe penalties including fines and imprisonment.</p>

            <h3>Educational Purpose</h3>
            <p>This course is designed for educational purposes only. The goal is to help you understand how these technologies work, appreciate security vulnerabilities in everyday systems, and use this knowledge responsibly - whether for authorized penetration testing, securing your own systems, or simply satisfying intellectual curiosity.</p>

            <h3>Your Responsibility</h3>
            <p>By continuing with this course and using your Flipper Zero, you acknowledge that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You are responsible for your own actions and must comply with all local laws</li>
                <li>tw¡st3d_¡nk Academy and course creators assume no responsibility for misuse of this information</li>
                <li>You will use these tools and knowledge ethically and legally</li>
                <li>You understand the potential consequences of unauthorized access or malicious use</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>Ethical Hacking Principles:</strong> True security professionals follow strict ethical guidelines. Always obtain written permission, never cause harm, respect privacy, and disclose vulnerabilities responsibly to those who can fix them.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
